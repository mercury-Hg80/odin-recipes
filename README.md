<p>The current project goes over different webpages and how they are linked along with incorporating the techniques learned from git basics, html, and command line basics.</p>

<p>The most difficult part from this project has been remembering the little nuances for setting up links, adding alt text, and remembering that the smallest addition of a period or slash can break something.</p>

<p>What I need to work on, go over the links and images portion of foundations, as well as the commit messages and reviewing the true meaning of some of the command line basics and connecting the terminal to git to make sure that I can do them without having to look for assistance </p>
