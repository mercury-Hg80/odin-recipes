        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This taco meat recipe makes the best filling for tacos. You have to buy everything else, of course. Make a big batch and use it for multiple different meals: add to bean burritos or mix with a can of beans (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for Frito pie, Navajo tacos, or taco salad.</p>
